I am a PhD student researching different strategies for scaling up diagnostic AI at the University of Edinburgh.

I focus on the shift from stand-alone ClinApps towards more concerted institutional and technical arrangements for the procurement, implementation and monitoring of diagnostic AI.

I work with multidisciplinary groups:
   STS (Science, Technology & Society): Institute for the Study of Science, Technology and Innovation
   Medical AI: UKRI Centre for Doctor Training of Biomedical AI
